# Connection to C

- Developed by Bjarne Stroustroup at Bell Labs in 1979
- C++ was designed to be a successor to C
- C++, in contrast to C, is implemented as an OO programming lang, but some compilers still support C programming


# Programming a C++ Application

- An executable is the finished product that can be run and should do what the programmer intended to achieve
- Here are the basic steps in creating apps in C++
1. Programming C++ code using a text editor or IDE
2. Compiling code using a C++ compiler that converts it to a machine language version contained in "object files"
3. Linking the output of the compiler using a linker to get an executable (.exe in Windows)

- Compilation is where C++ code in a file with extension .cpp is converted into byte code that the processor can execute
- The compiler compiles one code file at a time that generates an object file with a .o or .obj extension
    (and ignore the dependencies that the compiled file may have)
- The linker resolves the dependencies at a later point and if successful, creates an executable
