# How does an interpreted language differ from a compiled language?

- Langs like python, javascript are interpreted.
There is no compilation step and those langs use an interpreter that directly reads the script text file
or code and performs the desired actions.
Consequently, you need to have the interpreter installed on a machine where the script needs to be executed.
Performance takes a hit as the interpreter works as a runtime translator between the microprocessor and the code written.


# Runtime vs Compile Errors

- Runtime errors are errors that happen when you execute your application.
- Compile errors don't reach the end-user and are an indication of syntactical problems.
- Compile errors result in an unsuccessful attempt of generating an executable


# What is the diff btw an interpreter and a compiler

- An compiler takes your code and creates an object file and after linking creates an executable that can run 
    directly by the processor
- An interpreter interprets what you code and performs certain actions in realtime


# What does a linker do

- A compiler takes a code file as input and generates an object file in machine language.
- Your code often has dependencies on libraries and functions in other code files.
- Creating these links and generating an executable that integrates all dependdencies directly and indirectly
    coded by you is the job of the linker


# Code, compile, link, execute, debug
